Description
A project for my individual AFL2 assignment I made for my AFL 2 Project
Information
The frontend was created using ReactJS, the backend is created using expressJS, the database used for data persistence is Postgres.
From this project I've learned how to Develop the front and back end of a website using ReactJS and expressJS respectively and connect them to a Postgres Database, and in hindsight that this tech stack is easier to manage PHP'S laravel.
